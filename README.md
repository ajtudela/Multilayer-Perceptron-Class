Multilayer Perceptron Class
=====

Artificial Neural Network Class, programmed in [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B). 
I programed it years ago for a better understanding of the Neural Networks. Might have some bugs.

MLP has the following characteristics:
* Fully customizable layers, including multiple hidden layers.
* Two activation functions: [Sigmoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function) and [Hyperbolic tangent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_function).
* Backward propagation of errors using gradient descent (delta rule).
* NN weights backup once it learns.
* Learning algorithm with learning rate (alpha) and momentum(eta)

Data is displayed in console with several options (weights, bias, activations).
